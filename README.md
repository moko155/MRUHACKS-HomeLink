# MRUHACKS-HomeLink
HomeLink is a web app built for the MRU Hacks Hackathon under the theme "Linking".
It connects people through personalized, interactive profile “houses” — each element of the house (roof, window, and door) represents parts of a user’s story, achievements, and interests. Users can explore new communities, customize their virtual house, and link with others who share similar passions.
