/**
 * Vite TypeScript Declarations
 *
 * This file provides TypeScript type definitions for Vite-specific
 * features, such as importing assets (images, SVGs, etc.) and
 * environment variables (import.meta.env).
 *
 * By including this reference:
 *  - TypeScript can understand Vite's client APIs.
 *  - You get type checking and IntelliSense for Vite features.
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - This file is automatically created by Vite during project setup.
 *  - Do not remove it unless you fully manage Vite types manually.
